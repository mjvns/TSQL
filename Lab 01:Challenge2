Challenge 2: Retrieve Customer and Sales Data

1. Retrieve a list of customer companies
You have been asked to provide a list of all customer companies in the format <Customer ID> :
<Company Name> - for example, 78: Preferred Bikes. 
Soln:

SELECT TRY_CAST(CustomerID AS varchar(5)) +': '+ CompanyName
FROM SalesLT.Customer

2. Retrieve a list of sales order revisions
The SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table contains records of sales orders. You have been asked to retrieve
data for a report that shows:
 The sales order number and revision number in the format <Order Number> (<Revision>) – for
example SO71774 (2).
 The order date converted to ANSI standard format (yyyy.mm.dd – for example 2015.01.31).
Soln:

SELECT TRY_CAST(SalesOrderNumber AS varchar(8))+'('+TRY_CAST(RevisionNumber AS varchar(10))+')',
        TRY_CONVERT(nvarchar(30),OrderDate,102)
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader
