1. Retrieve customer details
Familiarize yourself with the Customer table by writing a Transact-SQL query that retrieves all columns
for all customers.
Soln:

SELECT * FROM SalesLT.Customer;

2. Retrieve customer name data
Create a list of all customer contact names that includes the title, first name, middle name (if any), last
name, and suffix (if any) of all customers.
Soln:

SELECT Title,firstName,middleName,lastName,suffix
FROM SalesLT.Customer;

3. Retrieve customer names and phone numbers
Each customer has an assigned salesperson. You must write a query to create a call sheet that lists:
 The salesperson
 A column named CustomerName that displays how the customer contact should be greeted (for
example, “Mr Smith”)
 The customer’s phone number.
Soln:

SELECT SalesPerson,'Mr'+' '+FirstName AS CustomerName, Phone
FROM SalesLT.Customer;
