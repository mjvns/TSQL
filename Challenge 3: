Challenge 3: Retrieve Customer Contact Details
1. Retrieve customer contact names with middle names if known
You have been asked to write a query that returns a list of customer names. The list must consist of a
single field in the format <first name> <last name> (for example Keith Harris) if the middle name is
unknown, or <first name> <middle name> <last name> (for example Jane M. Gates) if a middle name is
stored in the database.
Soln:

SELECT FIRSTNAME + ISNULL(MIDDLENAME,'') + LASTNAME AS CUSTOMERNAME
FROM SalesLT.Customer;

2. Retrieve primary contact details
Customers may provide adventure Works with an email address, a phone number, or both. If an email
address is available, then it should be used as the primary contact method; if not, then the phone
number should be used. You must write a query that returns a list of customer IDs in one column, and a
second column named PrimaryContact that contains the email address if known, and otherwise the
phone number.
Soln:

SELECT CustomerID, 
        COALESCE(EmailAddress,Phone) AS Primarycontact
        FROM SalesLT.Customer;
        
3. Retrieve shipping status
You have been asked to create a query that returns a list of sales order IDs and order dates with a
column named ShippingStatus that contains the text “Shipped” for orders with a known ship date, and
“Awaiting Shipment” for orders with no ship date.
Soln:

select salesorderid, orderdate,
CASE
    WHEN Shipdate IS NULL THEN 'Awaiting Shipment'
    ELSE cast(Shipdate as varchar)
END AS ShippingStatus
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader;
